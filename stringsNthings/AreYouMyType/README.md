# Are You My Type?

## Description

Positive integers can be classified as abundant, deficient, or perfect.
Abundant integers are those whose proper factors sum to a larger number. For
example, 36 is an abundant number because its proper factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9,
12, 18) sum to 55 which is greater than 36. Deficient integers are those whose
proper factors sum to a smaller number. For example, 27 is a deficient integer
because its proper factors (1, 3, 9) sum to 13 which is less than 27. Perfect
integers are those whose proper factors sum to exactly that number. For
example, 28 is a perfect integer because its proper factors (1, 2, 4, 7, 14)
sum to exactly 28. Given a positive integer value, determine if it is abundant,
deficient, or perfect. Also list its perfect factors and the sum of those
perfect factors.
